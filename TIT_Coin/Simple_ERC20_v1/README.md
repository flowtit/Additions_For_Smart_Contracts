A smart contract was assembled using the OpenZeppelin library.

Standard: ERC20;
Token name: TIT_Coin;
Token symbol (ticker): TIT;
Decimals: 14;
Total Supply: 3900000.

Scenarios that were tested by the tests:

1. That the name() method returns the same name;

2. That the symbol() method outputs the same symbol;

3. That the token's decimals() matches the given value;

4. That the totalSupply() of tokens matches the given value;

5. That the account to which the tokens were sent when the smart contract was created has the same amount of tokens on the balance as in totalSupply().
